                        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Mount Lipsett offers hikers a taste of the truly unique geography and environment of the Highwood Pass. The trailhead is easy to find and the trail easy to follow. It is on a very old and overgrown exploratory coal mining road, but after decades in retirement, it has taken the shape of a narrow trail weaving through thick forest. As it opens up, the trees give way to frequent views across the valley. Due to the gradual moderate incline and longer distance, there is plenty of opportunity to enjoy the wildflowers, colours, and smells of the forest, and of course the 360-degree views at the summit. The imposing and majestic wall of Mist Mountain to the east is the centre of attention. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">In summertime, snow may linger at higher elevations but should not be a cause to turn around. In wintertime, snowshoes may be a good idea if there has been a lot of recent snowfall, but microspikes and gaiters may suffice. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagrap">Parking can be found at a small clearing right at the trailhead. There are no facilities here, but they can be found five minutes north at the Ptarmigan Cirque parking lot, or 10 minutes south at the Pickle Jar Lakes / Lantern Creek parking lot. </p>
                        <p class="hikeDetails"> - distance 13.2km - elevation 697m - time 5 hours - moderate - </p>

                        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">This loop beginning from the trailhead has a rough gravel parking lot and it begins from the far left side of the lot. There are minimal signs but the trail is well traveled as it leads into the magical forest. The trail begins by climbing through the pristine forest and then becomes steeper. It then crossed a creek where there are multiple trails stemming from the area. Users absolutely recommend downloading the AllTrails verified maps so hikers can make sure they are on the right one. The correct route is by taking the trail to the left of the creek, which will provide amazing vistas here with beautiful views as well. The trail climbs some more then levels off for a little while before reaching the base of a dirt hill. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The trail then leads up the hill and it is a very steep, near-vertical climb with no footholds. Poles are absolutely necessary, especially for those who may have knee issues, since this is very challenging. The trail continues up the hill and climbs along a narrow path on the side of a gorge all the way to the top of the cirque. The footing of this area is unstable and uneven at times. Once at the top, there are incredible expansive views of the mountains in all directions and larch trees dotting the slopes - which is absolutely breathtaking! This hike would not be good for those afraid of heights, especially where the trails move along the ridges.</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The trail at the top of the cirque became non-existent since the ridge is not marked well, and many users will just treat this as an out-and-back if they don’t have the maps. The ridge remains to be very challenging and folks do recommend going super slow at times due to the elevation. This hike is no joke, and only kids with experience mountaineering should join adults for these technical challenges.</p>

                        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The Picklejar Lakes Trail is both popular, and commonly unknown as a jewel in the Canadian Rockies. Once discovered, users always return here since this is truly an awesome trail!</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Once on the trail, users will enjoy the varied experience - with the trail having some easy parts and some parts that are pretty challenging. To put this in perspective, users who are moderately active report often struggling during parts of this route due to incline, but being quite capable at other moments, as well. The trail is exactly five kilometres to the first lake, and then the trails continue on to the other lakes, which of course folks can instead turn back from there and make it a short 10-kilometre return trip. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">This is a trail where proper hiking footwear is required. There are some normal forest type trails, then dusty dirty type trails, and then finally  loose rock once you get closer to the lake. The loose rock will suck for ankles if users do not come prepared. During the summer months, it is recommended to arrive early in the day, since it does get quite hot here. Or wait for Fall, when the amazing Rocky Mountain fall colours come out. There are tree covered areas, but when the sun is high it doesn’t matter where the trees are - burn baby, burn! The exposed sections are very exposed, and any fair-skinned folks will want to be covered. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">This trail is heavily trafficked which is good because users often report not seeing any unexpected wildlife, except having to move over to pass others since the trail is only one-person wide so users will have to pull over quite a bit. Also, once users get down to the lake, it is wide open and is a great place to relax and to let animals swim.</p>
