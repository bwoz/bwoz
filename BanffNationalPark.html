                        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Johnston Canyon to Ink Pots Trail is an extremely popular and scenic trail in Banff National Park and is one of the busiest in the Canadian Rockies. This often results in long lines of slow moving visitors, especially in the summer months. Parking is limited to the parking lot only, so it is best to arrive early if using this area between June and August or else users will be stuck on the Bow Valley Parkway.</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The trail begins immediately behind the Johnston Canyon Lodge. Along the way users will pass over sturdy and well-maintained iron catwalks attached beneath overhanging canyon walls. After only about 1.1 kilometres, users will reach the lower falls. Visitors can get a better view of the falls by crossing the bridge over the creek and passing through a small tunnel, which opens right across from the mouth of the falls. Families with very young children may opt to turn around at this point, as the trail becomes slightly more difficult with some added elevation gain between the lower and upper falls. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">When visiting Johnston Canyon in the winter months, the majority of the trail becomes extremely slippery as it is often covered with thick ice due to the snow constantly melting and freezing throughout the season. It is strongly recommended that visitors come prepared with ice cleats/microspikes for better traction, and wear snowshoes if the snow is deep.</p>

                        <p class="hikeParagraph">This trail follows the north shore of Minnewanka Trail all the way to the upper Ghost Lakes, at the edge of Canada's first national park. Enjoy great views of the lake and surrounding mountains on this trail located a short way from downtown Banff.</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Lake Minnewanka lakeside trail begins by the marina. A large lot offers plenty of parking. Simply follow the path that hugs the shore. The first section is the one with the most elevation gain. The trail leads up to Cascade river and Stewart Canyon. It then continues along the shore with regular creek crossings, lookouts, and campgrounds that make for good picnic areas.</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">At camp M8, a short detour along Aylmer Pass trail leads up to the Aylmer lookout. This is a great spot to look down at the lake as it extends towards the town of Banff, and to enjoy an awesome panoramic view of Banff National Park. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The trail follows the lake around Mount Girouard, before pivoting the other way around Mount Costigan. In the final section you will pass more campgrounds and loop around the upper Ghost Lake. </p>
