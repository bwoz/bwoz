                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Watchtower Canyon via Medicine Lake is a 5.3 kilometer lightly trafficked out and back trail located near Improvement District No. 12 , Alberta, Canada that features a waterfall and is good for all skill levels. The trail is primarily used for hiking, rock climbing, and snowshoeing.</p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">After 20 minutes of gentle climbing, the canyon walls start to close and the unfolding scene is one of great beauty. Colourful, striated rock walls and large boulders scattered helter-skelter transport you to another world. You can’t believe you’re so close to civilization..</p>

                        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">The Athabasca Glacier is one of the easiest glaciers for any user to see, and is also one of Canada’s most famous frozen wonders. This area is a really neat spot, with plenty of tourist attractions in the small area, and this is very easy to find, thanks to the stop being located just off the Icefields Parkway. This trail follows the shortest route from the numerous parking lots, and there are even paid options to walk onto the glacier during the safest days, but most people choose to do this free short hike to simply view the glacier from afar. </p>
                        <p class="hikeParagraph">Most of the trail is easy to follow, but the area is very rocky but more like pebbles or very large stones that are mostly easy to walk on. The beginning of the hike is a long steep hill to enter the Columbia Icefields area which could be a challenge for some to do, especially when there are crowds here between June and September. Once having climbed the hill, it is very windy and cool most of the year, so wearing weather protection and even sunglasses can help protect users from the elements. This is a great way to witness the marvel of nature’s most significant glaciers, and how humans have impacted the environment with plenty of place markers to display how much the glacier has receded.</p>
